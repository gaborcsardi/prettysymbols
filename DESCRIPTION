Description: A small subset of Unicode symbols, that are useful when
    building command line applications. They fall back to alternatives on
    terminals that do not support Unicode.  Many symbols were taken from
    the 'figures' 'npm' package (see
    <https://github.com/sindresorhus/figures>).
